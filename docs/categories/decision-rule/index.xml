      <description>We start with \(\theta&amp;gt;0\) and \(E[X|\theta]=\theta\) and \(Var[X|\theta]=\theta^2\)
We have a class of decision rules that are \(S=\{\delta_c(X)=cX, 0 &amp;lt; c &amp;lt; 1\}\)
and weâ€™re give the standard squared loss funciton \(L(\theta,a) = (\theta - a)^2\)
To find a decision rule in \(S\) that is admissible means finding a decision rule \(\delta_{c}\) for there exists no other decision rule that is R-better than \(\delta_{c}\)
We can find such a decision rule by finding \(\delta_{c}\) for which the Risk is the minimum possible.</description>
