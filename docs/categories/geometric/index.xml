      <description>Consider simple experiment with two possible outcomes: success or failure. Geometric distribution describes the number of successes in a sequence of independent experiments performed until the first failed one. Formally, if \(\xi_1,\xi_2,\ldots\) are results of experiments (that is all \(\xi\) are independent and have Bernoulli distribution), then the geometric random variables is \[ X=\min\{n\geq 0:\xi_{n+1}=0\}. \] (There are other modifications of a geometric distribution, for example when the first fail is also counted).</description>
