Bernoulli distribution describes an outcome of a single experiment with two possible outcomes (success or failure): $X=1$ if an experiment was successfull, $X=0$ if it was not.

Parameter: $p$ -- probability of a success.

Values: $\{0,1\}.$

Probability mass function:
$$
P(X=1)=p, \ P(X=0)=1-p.
$$

Moment generating function:
$$
M(t)=1-p+pe^t
$$


{\it Proof.} 
$$
M(t)=Ee^{tX}=e^t\cdot P(X=1)+e^0\cdot P(X=0)=pe^t+1-p
$$


All moments:
$$
EX^n=p, \ n\geq 1.
$$

{\it Proof}
Observe that $X^n=X,$ for $n\geq 1.$ Further,
$$
EX=1\cdot P(X=1)+0\cdot P(X=0)=p+0=p
$$


Expectation: $EX=p$

Variance: $V(X)=p(1-p)$
