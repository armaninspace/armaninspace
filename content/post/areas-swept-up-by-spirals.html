<p>A friend of mine and I were re-visiting Eulerâ€™s identity: <span class="math inline">\(e^{ \pm i\theta } = \cos \theta \pm i\sin \theta\)</span> and we started looking at spirals of the form: <span class="math inline">\((e^z)^n = [r (\cos \theta \pm i\sin \theta)]^n\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> are fixed while n varies from <span class="math inline">\((-\infty, \infty)\)</span></p>
